``==`` and ``!=`` warnings finalized
------------------------------------
The ``==`` and ``!=`` operators on arrays now always:

* raise errors that occur during comparisons
* return an array of all ``True`` or all ``False`` when values are
  fundamentally not comparable (e.g. have different dtypes).

For a long time these gave ``DeprecationWarning`` or ``FutureWarning``.
This mimics the Python behavior of returning ``False`` and ``True``
when comparing incompatible types like ``"a" == 1`` and ``"a" != 1``.
