Default build against NumPy is now backwards compatible
-------------------------------------------------------
Starting with NumPy 1.25 when including NumPy headers, NumPy now
defaults to exposing a backwards compatible API.
This means that by default binaries such as wheels build against
NumPy 1.25 will also work with NumPy 1.17.

You can customize this behavior using::

    #define NPY_TARGET_VERSION NPY_1_22_API_VERSION

or the equivalent ``-D`` option to the compiler.  For more details
please see `for-downstream-package-authors`_.
A change should only be required in rare cases when a package relies on newly
added C-API.
